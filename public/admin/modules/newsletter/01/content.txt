<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Thursday 29th March 2012</span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed 3 new categories have appeared in the web-shop. These will contain some very special, limited stock offers for you during April. I will activate these before midday on Monday 2nd April. Now the stock control feature is active you will be able to see exactly how many of each item there is.</span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">The 3 categories are: 'Gift Time!', 'To Clear' and 'Value Packs'. The Value Packs are 25gm bags, which are priced at a 20% discount to the usual 10gm bag price. I am posting a few popular colours to start with and, if you like them, please let me know and I will increase the availability and/or range offered. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;"> Most of the 'Gift Time!' and 'Value Pack' offered are only single items, so it really is a case of first come, first served. Good luck to you all!</span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">We will be closed for the entire Easter weekend this year due to family commitments. We will be open as usual 10am - 4pm on Maundy Thursday, 5th April, and will re-open at 10am on Tuesday 10th April.</span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">We will also be closed on Friday 18th May for a family wedding.</span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">September sees us off to Scotland for our annual holiday. The last mailing day will be Friday 14th, the shop will be open on Saturday 15th and Sunday 16th sees us heading over the border for 2 weeks. We will be attending the Edinburgh Bead Fair on Sunday 30th and I will be back in the shop on Monday 1st October to start catching up with all the orders!</span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">I have started a new bead group - <a href="http://www.charismabeads.co.uk/pages/u_f_o_beaders.php" target="_blank">UFO Beaders</a>. This group runs on the 2nd Monday of each month (except April which will be a week later, on 16th April, to avoid Easter) from 4pm - 8pm. You are welcome to come in and leave at any time during the session. I've called it UFO (UnFinished Object) because we all have projects under way that we need a bit of advice or reassurance in order to finish, or projects we wish to do that we can't seem to get going on for some reason. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Sue Stallard and I will both be here to give any help and advice that may be needed.The March session was great fun and extremely valuable to those of us who were there, including Sue and me!</span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">The workshops planned so far this year are now all on the website. Please have a look at the <a href="http://www.charismabeads.co.uk/pages/workshops.php" target="_blank">workshops</a> page for details.<br /></span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">We 	are attending even more shows this year (details on the <a href="http://www.charismabeads.co.uk/pages/fairs.php" target="_blank">'Fairs'</a> page of 	the website) and we hope many more of you will come and introduce 	yourselves to us. It's really nice to be able to put faces, and 	voices, to the many familiar names who are regular customers on the 	web.</span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Welcome  to the many new bead workers who have been finding our web-shop  recently. We hope you continue to find that we have, probably, the most  extensive range of Miyuki beads available in the UK, and that we can  continue to provide you all with the high level of customer service we  are famous for. We are very proud that so much of our business comes  from personal recommendation and we thank all of you who are helping to  'spread the word' about Charisma Beads.</span></p>
